        <h2Â className='boardText'> If there are two things Coloradans love (or at least love to talk about), it's dogs and 14-ers.<br/> 14-ers are mountains who's summit is over 14,000ft. <br/>Once you make it to the top tired and oxygen deprived, of course you want to snap a pic with the sign at the top. But what about your trusty four legged friend? Do they not deserve a flex?
        Here at wieners on 14ers, we give your dog a platform for a humble brag. Also check out our complete list of 14ers that you can hike up next time<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/></h2>
